= PegLeg Parser

== Intro and Motivation
PegLegParser implements a Parsing Expression Grammar (PEG) framework. 

PEGs are an interesting branch of parsing; read about them further on
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing_expression_grammar[Wikipedia].

I was first exposed to PEGs via the excellent
https://github.com/sirthias/parboiled/wiki[Parboiled parsing library]. I used it
a bunch of times to build lots of small parsers, and by and large it went well.
PEGS can do a lot* of backtracking, so they are rarely the fastest parsers, but
with seven core rules, they are really nice to work with. Plus, it can be
*really* nice to not have to work in one kind of source file, then use a build
plugin to generate your target parser code, as ANTLR and JavaCC and friends have
you do. (I'm a big JavaCC fan as well.)

But Parboiled was built in the pre-Java-8 days, before lambdas etc. 
Because of that, and I assume other reasons, Parboiled uses bytecode generation, 
Proxies, etc to expose a natural API. 

As I mostly hate extraneous dependencies, I always wanted to do a PEG impl like
Parboiled, but with no fancy code manipulation. After Java 8 was released, it seemed
like it could be done without all the low level machinations. PegLeg is my attempt to
do so. 

== Core Concepts

When you write a parser using PegLeg, you start by extending the PegLegParser
class, typed by the kind of value you will be placing on the value stack.\

Note: By default, the pasrser recognizes any character in the string `" \n\r\f"` 
as whitespace; change that with the `setWhitespace(String)` method.

Also, regarding the input string, the parser defaults to `System.lineSeparator()`
for the end of line string. If it is anything but '\n', the input string has every
instance of the line separator replaced with '\n'. You can set the seperator string
directly via `setLineSeparator()` if you wish. In general, it would be best to
filter the input to newlines only, and set the line separator the same to
avoid the overhead.

=== Terminal Rules
PegLeg provides a number of terminal rules to help things along: 

* `eof()` -- end of input
* `eol()` -- end of a line. depends on the line separator set for the 
parser. Can be multichar.
* `ws()` -- greedy matches the whitespace chars
* `anyChar()` -- matches any character
* `nothing()` -- matches nothing, fails match
* `empty()` -- matches nothing, successful matches
* Character/String literals:
** `ch(char)` -- matches the char
** `str(String)` -- matches the string literal
** `charRange(char from, char to)` -- matches character range.
** `ws(String)` -- matches the string, surrounded by 0 or more white space chars
*** (basically, this is a specialized version of `seqOf(zeroPlusOf(ws()), str(String), zeroPlusOf(ws()))`
** `ws(char)` -- matches the char, surrounded by 0 or more white space chars
** `anyOf(String)` -- matches 1 char, from the set in the string
** `noneOf(String)` -- matches 1 char, not in the set in the string

IMPORTANT: All of these add a .ignoreCase() call returning a variant that ignores case so
you can do `charRange('a', 'b').ignoreCase()`, for example.

==== PegLeg Core PEG Rules
These are PegLeg's take on the core PEG rules:

IMPORTANT: For each of the following rules that take `(Object... rules)` as an
argument, the argument list of rules is actually treated like it was invoked via
`seqOf(rule1, rule2, rule3)`, generating an implicit single rule, with the
exception of `firstOf()` and, well, `seqOf()` itself.

* `seqOf(Object... rules)` -- Sequence rule; it only matches if every subrule
provided matches, in order. One rule to rule them all.
* `firstOf(Object... rules)` -- Choice rule; tries each subrule in order, stops
successfully on the first match.
* Repeating rules
** `zeroPlusOf(Object... rules)` -- ZeroOrMore rule; classic __*__ rule, greedy.
** `onePlusOf(Object... rules)` -- OneOrMore rule; classic __+__ rule, greedy.
** `optOf(Object... rules)` -- Optional rule; classic __?__ rule, greedy.
** `timesOf(int many, Object... rules)` -- matches only if the subrule matches
a specific number of times
** `timesOf(int min, int max, Object... rules)` -- matches only if the subrule matches
at least *min*, up to *max*, greedy.

NOTE: Note that `zeroPlusOf`, `onePlusOf`, `optOf`, `timesOf(int many,...)` are all just
specialized variants of the `timesOf(int min, int max, ...)`.

* Test rules
** `testOf(Object... rules)` -- Test (__&__) rule, matches if only the subrule matches, but
does not consume input. Used to lookahead.
** `testNotOf(Object... rules)` -- Test (__!__) rule, matches if only the subrule does not match,
does not consume input. Used to lookahead.

----
These two rules explain a lot of why PEGs are not the most efficient
parsers, lots of lookahead tends to be needed to make unambigious choices.
----

All of these rules actually return `ParentRule` objects, which gives you the ability
to denote `Ref<>` objects for usage during an invocation of the rule. Like so:

[source,java]
----
public PEGRule<String> myRule() {
	Ref<Integer> intRef=new Ref<Integer>(0);
	return seqOf(aRule(), bRule(), cRule().refs(intRef).rule();
}
----

This manages the visible value for the duration of the rule invocation. More later.
 
==== Rule Definition
Let's pick the best rule; the `seqOf(Object... rules)` rule. 

The objects in the argument list to `seqOf()` (and all the other provided non-terminal 
rules) can be of a few different types:

* an instance of `PegLegRule`
** all of the provided PegLeg rules, such as `ch()`, `anyOf()`, `zeroPlusOf()`, etc,
implement `PegLegRule`.
** you will write methods returning `PegLegRule`; this is how the grammar is constructed.
* a __character literal__ -- automatically converted to a `ch()` rule
* a __string literal__ -- automatically converted to a `str()` rule
* an `Exec` lambda, which is just like a sort of boolean function, and 
can execute any arbitrary code needed to build things from the parse run,
(more on this later). Returning true means parsing continues, false indicates 
a failed match. 
* a `Runnable`, which gets wrapped in an `exec(Runnnable)` call. Note that the
exec(Runnable) method provides an easy way to define these as lambdas 
without needing to cast the lambda. 

So, for example:

[source,java]
----
class Foo extends PegLegParser<Object> {

	PegLegRule<Object> abcd() {
		return seqOf('a', 'b', 'c', 'd');
	}

}
----

defines a rule that machines the characters 'abcd' in order. 

By nesting, you can build up more complicated matches:

[source,java]
----
class Foo extends PegLegParser<Object> {

	PegLegRule<Object> abcd() {
		return seqOf(ab(), cd());
	}

	PegLegRule<Object> ab() {
		return seqOf('a', 'b');
	}

	PegLegRule<Object> cd() {
		return seqOf('c', 'd');
	}

}
----

There is one hitch; recursion. Imagine this class:

[source,java]
----
class ABCGrammer extends PegLegParser<Object> {

   public PegLegRule<Object> S() {
       return seqOf(testOf(seqOf(A(), 'c')), onePlusOf('a'), B(), testNotOf(anyOf("abc")), eof());
   }

   public PegLegRule<Object> A() {
       return seqOf('a', optOf(A()), 'b');
   }

   public PegLegRule<Object> B() {
       return seqOf('b', optOf(B()), 'c');
   }
}
----

This class matches either "abc" or "aabbcc" etc.

Except it won't work, because the recursion in `A()` and `B()` causes a stack
overflow exception, since the call chain for both methods goes right to itself.
The fix for this is very easy; in the rule definition, instead of returning the
rule directly, you return a lambda of the rule:

[source,java]
----
class ABCGrammer extends PegLegParser<Object> {

   public PegLegRule<Object> S() {
       return seqOf(testOf(seqOf(A(), 'c')), onePlusOf('a'), B(), testNotOf(anyOf("abc")), eof());
   }

   public PegLegRule<Object> A() {
       return () -> seqOf('a', optOf(A()), 'b').rule();
   }

   public PegLegRule<Object> B() {
       return () -> seqOf('b', optOf(B()), 'c').rule();
   }
}
----

In this way, you decouple the creation of the rule from the execution of the 
rule. Note that the terminal rules do not do this (they are terminal after all).

Also note that Rule's implicitly expect to be able to reside in a class that
implements Supplier<Context<V>> to get to the context of the parser; usually
this is the parser itself; the Rules make use of `get()` to see whats going on. 
Feel free to have a hierarchy of parsing code tho.

=== Exec() calls
The `e(Runnable)`, `exec(Runnable)` and `testExec(Exec)` are the ways 
you "call out" in the middle of parsing and do stuff (construct a node of objects, 
etc). 

Example:

[source,java]
----
class Foo extends PegLegParser<Object> {

	PegLegRule<Object> abcd() {
		Ref<Integer> refInt = new Ref<>(0);
		return seqOf(
			'a',
			(Runnable)() -> System.out.println("a match = "+get().match());
			'b',
			exec(() -> System.out.println("b match = "+get().match()));
			'c',
			testExec(() -> {
				System.out.println("c match = "+get().match()));
				ref.set(ref.get()+1);
				return ref.get()<10;
			}
			'd').refs(refInt);
	}
}
----

Here you see our silly grammar again, for 'abcd'. Only now, we are
going to do some callouts as we match. 

(The `.refs()` call tells the rule to provisions a new temp copy of the `refInt`
variable, to it's init value of zero. This copy is live only for the duration of
the rule invocation, and is not shared with recursive calls below. The value
will disappear when rule execution ends. More about `Ref` variables later.)

The first case shows a simple Runnable callout. Since the args to `seqOf()`
are just Objects, it is necessary to cast it. It just prints the match.

The second case uses the `exec(Runnable)` sugar to avoid the wordy cast,
but does the same thing.

Finally, the last case shows a full Exec lambda, which increments the 
`Ref` variable and then return true or false based on whether it is less
than 10. If it returns false, parsing will stop. 

=== Values() Stack & Ref Variables

==== Values object
Each parsing run has access to a typed stack of values. This is how you return 
values from one rule to another, by stack manipulation. Via the `values()` method
on the parser (which is a call through to the one on the current Context) you 
obtain access to a stack, with normal operations like `push()`, `pop()`, etc. 

If a rule fails to match, the value stack is returned to the state it was in 
prior to the rule's invocation. So the side effects of failed operations are 
never seen. 

Also, the two test predicates `testOf()` and `testNotOf()` always restore the 
stack to its prior state.

The Values() object is primarily intended to be used to communicate from one 
rule to another. In effect, the Values() object functions as the call/return 
stack in normal programming; you can push an object on to communicate with a 
routine you are going to call, and use it to return values from the same call; 
but you have to do the same thing each time for a given rule, hence you need 
*stack stability* across rule calls.    

==== Ref Variables

Another way to manipulate data is through Ref variables. Much like the Values
object, Ref variables are reset to their init value prior to the rule invocation,
then reset to the prior value at the end of the rule invocation.

Basically, the Ref variables function like a stack of values, each new rule 
invocation allocates a new one, and only sees that one, until it is done, at which 
point it is popped off the stack.

Ref variables are basically desined to commincate within sibling 
exec() calls in the same rule, that need a different type than the stack 
is typed as.


== Parser Usage

Sample ABC grammar:

[source,java]
----
class ABCGrammer extends PegLegParser<Object> {

   public PegLegRule<Object> S() {
       return seqOf(testOf(seqOf(A(), 'c')), onePlusOf('a'), B(), testNotOf(anyOf("abc")), eof());
   }

   public PegLegRule<Object> A() {
       return () -> seqOf('a', optOf(A()), 'b').rule();
   }

   public PegLegRule<Object> B() {
       return () -> seqOf('b', optOf(B()), 'c').rule();
   }
 }
----

This implements the standard A(n times)B(n times)C(n times) grammar; see
Wikipedia's article on PEG parsers for more info.

To use it, one does something like this:

[source,java]
----
parser = new ABCGrammar();
parser.using("AABBCC");
ReturnValue<Object> ret = parser.parse(parser.S());
----

In this case, you intialize the parser, give it the string you will be parsing,
then invoke the rule you wish to parse via the `.parse()` method.

`RuleReturn<?>` gives you lots of info about how the parse engine went; you can get:

* `matched()` -- if the rule matched.
* `matchPos()` -- absolute position in input string where the match started
* `matchLine()` -- line number it match on, 1 is the first line
* `matchLineOffset()` -- position on the line it matched at (0 first column)
* `matchLen()` -- length of the matched literal
* `ctx()` -- supplies context for this match. only useful for last match, valid at end of parsing run.

you can then, in our example above, get the actual matched literal like this:

[source,java]
----
parser = new ABCGrammar();
parser.using("AABBCC");
ReturnValue<Object> ret = parser.parse(parser.S());
String match = ret.ctx().match().orElse("NO!!!!!");
System.out.println(match);
// or...
String match = parser.match().orElse("NO!!!!!");
System.out.println(match);
----

== JSON Example Grammar

In the PegLegTest class, there is a JSON test grammar using the
JSONOne JSON library.

This grammar is interesting for a number of reasons. It types it's values as
`JSONOne.JObject`'s, pushing and popping them off the stack as values are
parsed. It also uses Ref's for building the map and array objects, and passes
the Ref's into methods for further processing.

It is also (at the time of writing) 111 lines long vs 337 lines for the hand
built one, and took very little time to do.   

== Error Handling
There mostly isn't any yet. Coming, at least enough to be able to tell you 
what the last match and position was.

== Things to Dislike

There are a bunch of limitations, odd corners, etc.

* I would much rather have user level args and a return value than Refs and
the Values object, but near as I can tell, I can't do that easily. Ref vars 
and the Values stack are a simpler, smaller substitute, but I don't love it.

* Error handling isn't. Need to work on that.

* Perf will never be the strong suit. I could memoize, packrat, etc, but
that would be a lot more work, and certainly not fit the ethos here.

* PegLeg will generate a fair amount of YoungGen memory traffic, I think.

* The line ending management is blah. Literally, whatever you set the line
separator string to is replaced with newlines only prior to parsing, 
which is ... a bit over the top. OTOH, greatly simplifies the character 
parsing code, by making end of line ident easy, and given the backtracking,
it would be inefficient to do it on the fly.

* The 1000 line limit hurts in other ways; no room to build a Reader impl
with (essentially) unlimited pushback and random access to characters in
the stream. So PegLeg needs to have the whole string as input, which 
stinks.

But in the end, I am not so much interested in The World's Greatest Parser; 
parsing itself is not a direct interest of mine. So someone else is welcome
to tear it apart and make it much more efficient. Just not here, 
unless you can get it under 1000 lines, one file, of course. :-)
